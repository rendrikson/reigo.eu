<p>Short description of R package <code>DT</code> from its <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/">website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The R package DT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library <a href="(https://datatables.net/)">DataTables</a>. R data objects (matrices or data frames) can be displayed as tables on HTML pages, and DataTables provides filtering, pagination, sorting, and many other features in the tables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice it means that we can easily publish interactable HTML tables to our reports, dashboards, blog posts etc. To learn more about <code>DT</code> visit <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/" class="uri">https://rstudio.github.io/DT/</a>. As you can imagine, there is lot of stuff you can do with your <code>datatable</code>, so even if you have used <code>datatable()</code> function for a while, <strong>Iâ€™ll highly recommend to take a look to the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/">DT website</a></strong>. I found it to be full of useful examples.</p>
<div id="child-rows" class="section level1">
<h1>Child Rows</h1>
<p>There is <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/002-rowdetails.html">an example</a> of <code>datatable</code> with child rows published in <code>DT</code> website. The example, in turn, is adapted from DataTables <a href="https://datatables.net/examples/api/row_details.html">website</a>. In this post I will extend <code>DT</code> <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/002-rowdetails.html">child rows example</a> such that it will look more similar to the original. I start by downloading example data from <a href="https://datatables.net/extensions/buttons/examples/initialisation/export.html">DataTables</a> website and save it as <code>dt-export-ex.csv</code>. Next I will load necessary packages, read data to R and add <code>Employee ID</code> variable to data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
x &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;dt-export-ex.csv&quot;)
x[[&quot;Employee ID&quot;]] &lt;- round(runif(nrow(x)) * 10000)</code></pre>
<p>I use <a href="#datatable2"><code>datatable2()</code></a> function (see full code <a href="#datatable2">below</a>) to embed <code>datatable</code> with child rows to this document:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>datatable2(
  x = x, 
  vars = c(&quot;Employee ID&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;, &quot;Start date&quot;),
  opts = list(pageLength = 5)
)</code></pre>

<p>When clicking on the + sign we can see additional information about any given row. I think that <code>datatable</code> produced with <code>databale2()</code> function looks quite similar to <a href="https://datatables.net/examples/api/row_details.html">original example</a>. Also, the benefit of making a function out of it allows us to specify other options available for <code>DT::datatable()</code> functions, which hopefully makes <code>datatable2()</code> to fit better in my (or yours) workflow.</p>
