      <description>Estonian National Broadcasting Agency run a wonderful campaign called “Eesti loeb” (Estonia reads), where people were asked to post a picture of themselves with a book they are reading (or have read) and find inspiring. Photos of readers with their favourite books were published afterwards.
But which books are the most popular ones among Estonians? We are going to answer this question (inspired by the campaign) by analyzing books read by people in Eesti Estonia group in goodreads.</description>
